## About Me 🧑🏼💻

Hi, i'm a passionate developer with a growing foundation in cybersecurity and backend development. I hold certifications in CompTIA Security+ and Cisco Cybersecurity Support, and I enjoy building real-world tools that combine system monitoring, automation, and protection. My experience includes developing a Python-based antivirus solution with AI-driven threat detection, building and managing FiveM game server systems, and customizing vehicle data for optimized in-game performance. I continuously seek to expand my technical abilities across cybersecurity, scripting, and system-level programming while contributing to creative and secure solutions.

## Projects 🚀

- **[AntiVirus Project](https://github.com/nikokrekic/PythonAntVirus)**  
  Collaborated with an AI assistant (ChatGPT) to develop a custom Python-based antivirus solution, incorporating real-time process monitoring, AI-driven threat detection using the BODMAS dataset, and a whitelist system to authorize trusted applications. The project featured behavioral analysis for suspicious activity, SQLite logging for event tracking, and a conceptual remote admin panel for managing applications, IPs, and ports. This hands-on experience strengthened my skills in scripting, endpoint protection, and system behavior analysis while demonstrating the ability to leverage AI tools for real-world cybersecurity development.
  
- **[Bundle of FiveM Vehicles](https://github.com/nikokrekic/FiveM-RealPack)**  
  This Vehicle bundle pack containing over 100+ vehicles that work flawlessly withing fivem using XML scripting and 3D Models to provide the best experiance while playing withing a FiveM server.

- **[FiveM Server](https://discord.gg/vicevirtuerp)**  
  As a developer whithin Vice & Virtue, I manage a thriving FiveM server in America, attracting a community of hundreds. This experience taught me valuable skills in server hosting, configuration, and troubleshooting, along with XML and Lua scripting experience.
